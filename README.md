# Netflix-Analytics
End-to-end data analytics project using SQL, Python, statistical testing, regression forecasting, and NLP clustering to uncover trends, growth patterns, and thematic structures in the Netflix catalog.
# Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end analytical study of the Netflix titles dataset using SQL and Python.
The objective was to simulate a real-world analytics workflow:
- Transform raw CSV data into a structured SQL database
- Perform exploratory and relational analysis
- Apply statistical testing
- Build predictive models
- Extract latent themes using NLP

The project demonstrates skills in data engineering, analytics, statistical inference, and machine learning.
# Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQLite

- Top 10 content-producing countries
- Most frequent actors and director–actor collaborations
2. Time-Based Trend Analysis
- Content growth between 2010–2021
- Movies vs TV Shows yearly comparison
- Visualization of release trends
3. Relational Database Engineering
- Normalized cast and country tables
- SQL JOIN queries for collaboration insights
- Advanced aggregation queries with CASE logic
5. Predictive Modeling
- Linear Regression model to forecast catalog growth
- Predicted number of titles through 2026
- Time-series trend interpretation
5. Statistical Inference
- ANOVA test to evaluate differences in movie duration across content ratings
- Determined statistical significance (p-value analysis)
6. NLP & Unsupervised Learning
- TF-IDF vectorization of title descriptions
- K-Means clustering to identify latent thematic groupings
- Extracted top keywords per cluster
